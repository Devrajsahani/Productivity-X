## 🧠 Project Overview

**Productivity-X** is a modern web app built to consolidate multiple productivity tools under one roof.  
This project marks the *second step* in my journey to becoming a **Full Stack Developer** —  
after mastering backend fundamentals, I moved into learning **React.js** and built this project to put all those concepts into real-world use.

I started by learning React from **Chai aur Code (Hitesh Choudhary)** on YouTube and then implemented the concepts from scratch — not just watching, but actually building, debugging, and experimenting to make sure I understood the “why” behind every concept.
